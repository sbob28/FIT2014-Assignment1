# FIT2014 Assignment 1: Linux Tools, Logic, Regular Expressions, and Induction

## Overview
This repository contains solutions for **Assignment 1** of FIT2014, focusing on topics such as Linux tools, logic, regular expressions, and induction. The assignment consists of five problems requiring the use of `awk` scripting, Boolean logic, and mathematical reasoning.

## Files
The following files are included in this repository:

- **`prob1.txt`**: Contains the Boolean expression for Problem 1 in a single line.
- **`prob2.awk`**: An `awk` script that generates a Boolean expression for a graph \( G \) to check if it has a triangle-free vertex cover (Problem 2).
- **`prob3.pdf`**: A PDF with:
  - The number of clauses of \( \phi_G \) in terms of \( m \) (edges) and \( t \) (triangles).
  - An upper bound for \( t \) in terms of \( m \).
  - An upper bound for the number of clauses of \( \phi_G \) in terms of \( m \).
- **`prob4.awk`**: A modified `awk` script that outputs a `SageMath` command to check the satisfiability of \( \phi_G \) (Problem 4).
- **`prob5.pdf`**: A PDF with:
  - Boolean expression \( \phi_X \) for a specific 2-regular graph \( X \).
  - Proof by induction that \( \phi_G \) for any 2-regular graph \( G \) has at most \( \frac{4n}{3} \) clauses.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Linux environment with `awk` installed.
- `SageMath` for satisfiability testing.
- PDF reader for reviewing written solutions.
